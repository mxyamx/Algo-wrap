/**
 * Algo-wrap â€” partition
 *
 * Description:
 * Splits the array into [pass, fail] based on a predicate, preserving order
 * within each group. Returns new arrays; input is unchanged.
 *
 * Complexity:
 *   Time:  O(n)
 *   Space: O(n) (two output arrays)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Stable within each partition.
